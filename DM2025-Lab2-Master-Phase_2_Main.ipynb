      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",

      "His style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \n",
      "face, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \n",
      "example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n",
      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",
      "travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n",
      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nReview – Avatar: Fire and Ash \\nAvatar: Fire and Ash (2025), directed by James Cameron, continues his \\nreputation for building expansive cinematic worlds that place characters in \\noverwhelming circumstances and push visual storytelling to extraordinary limits. His \\nstyle in previous films establishes protagonists in richly imagined environments with \\ntowering conflicts, and he once again uses the vastness of Pandora to challenge both \\nhis characters and his audience. Cameron’s work in Avatar (2009) and The Way of \\nWater (2022) already demonstrated his fascination with ecological systems and \\ncultural tension, and this new chapter appears to deepen those themes through \\nharsher landscapes and more volatile intertribal conflict. \\nThis time, the story brings viewers into Pandora’s volcanic badlands, home of the \\nAsh People—a Na’vi clan shaped by fire, ash, and survival in one of the planet’s most \\nhostile regions. Early reports describe this tribe as more militant and spiritually \\ndivergent, creating immediate tension with Jake Sully’s family as they seek refuge \\namong rival clans. The introduction of a Na’vi civil conflict shifts the series away from \\na simple humans-versus-Na’vi structure and toward a more complex internal struggle, \\nsuggesting broader thematic ambition and emotional stakes. \\nThroughout the film, Cameron uses these new environments to explore \\nunfamiliar physical challenges and dynamic action sequences. Volcanic storms, ash-\\ncovered battlegrounds, and explosive terrain add fresh layers to the visual spectacle \\nthat the franchise is known for. According to industry commentary, the film’s runtime \\nexceeds three hours, giving Cameron room to develop these worlds in detail while \\nexpanding character arcs and intertribal tensions that shape the narrative. \\nA central focus of anticipation surrounds the character of Quaritch, whose \\ntransformation in previous films leads to an identity crisis that could define his role in \\nFire and Ash. Reports suggest he may face conflicts between his human memories \\nand Na’vi form, hinting at possible moral ambiguity or even redemption. This \\ncontinues Cameron’s long-running interest in characters caught between biological, \\ntechnological, or cultural identities—an interest clearly visible across his filmography. \\nThe anticipation surrounding Fire and Ash also reflects Cameron’s commitment\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nto scale and innovation. Reports mention that Disney CEO Bob Iger praised the film as \\n“magnificent,” suggesting Camerons continued pursuit of visual and technical \\nbreakthroughs has resonated with studio leadership. This aligns with Cameron’s \\nhistory of pushing cinema forward through new technology, whether in CGI, motion \\ncapture, or world-building. \\nAlthough the full film has not yet been released at the time of early reviews, the \\nimagery, tone, and narrative direction presented so far imply a project that continues \\nCameron’s tendency toward massive emotional and visual ambition. His exploration \\nof ecological themes, cultural divergence, and identity crisis suggests a story that is as \\nmuch about survival and reconciliation as it is about spectacle. If executed well, Fire \\nand Ash could become one of the most impactful entries in the franchise, balancing \\nCameron’s signature world-building with a deeper examination of Pandora’s internal \\ndivisions. \\nOverall, Avatar: Fire and Ash seems poised to deliver another expansive, visually \\nstriking chapter in the series. With its darker environments, escalating conflict, and \\npotential for complex character evolution, the film continues to reflect Cameron’s \\nlong-standing strengths as a filmmaker who blends technological innovation with \\nemotionally driven storytelling.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

It involves providing a few examples of question and answer pairs (or other task types) in the input data to guide the model on what format to use.

      "Prompt engineering is a technique that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to be adapted to any task without requiring fine-tuning. It involves providing a few examples of question and answer pairs (or other task types) in the input data to guide the model on what format to use. It can also involve generating an instruction based on user input and then using that instruction and input as input to another instance of the model to complete the output. This \"self-instruct\" ability helps LLMs bootstrap themselves toward a correct answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
